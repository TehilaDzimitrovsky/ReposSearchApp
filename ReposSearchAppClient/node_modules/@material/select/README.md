Before running the server side and the client side, the DB must be prepared.
DB - SQL SERVER using FirstCode.
Open a DB named: SearchReposDB in your SQLSERVER SSMS.
Replace the correct ConnectionString in the launchSettings of the SERVER project(inside the 'properties' folder).
Run an initial migration to update the DB (Add-Migration firstMigration -context AppContext).
Run update-database.
Run server side
Run client side ng serve --open.

Good luck :)
